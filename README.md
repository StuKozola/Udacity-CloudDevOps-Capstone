## Dependencies
This project has been developed and validated on Ubuntu linux.  A makefile is provided that can be used for installing, configuring, and running this project on a desktop or VM from the git repository.  If you are using a different platform, you will need to have these dependencies installed prior using this repo.
1. git
2. make
3. python 3.8+
4. python3-venv

### Data Scientists Sandbox
The commands shown below will install, build, test, and run MLFlow with all the required dependencies on Ubuntu.  This configuration is the minimalist configuration in that it installs MLFlow and it's dependencies only. 
```bash
    make setup-ubuntu
    make install-local
    make build-local
    make run-local
```
After running these commands, you should see the MLFlow experiment tracking app in a local browser (http://127.0.0.1:5000).

### Desktop Development with Minikube
This configuration will build and test a local development environment that mirrors the AWS deployed application.  It uses:
1. [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to replicate [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for images and image scanning
3. [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) for linting Dockerfiles
4. [MinIO](https://min.io) for S3 bucket emulation
5. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for MLFlow backend storage

To install and run on a clean Ubuntu installation:   
```bash
    make setup-ubuntu
    make install-local-k8
    make build-local-k8
    make run-local-k8
```
After running these commands, you should see the MLFlow experiment tracking app in a local browser (http://127.0.0.1:5000).

You can also run `make clean` to clean up temporary downloaded files, and `make destroy` to shut down and delete pods created in minikube.
